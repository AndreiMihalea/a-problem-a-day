1. Given a list of numbers and a number k, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to k. (Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?)
2. Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index i of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at i. (Follow-up: what if you can't use division?)
